April 2025 - Version 0.2 released

It's been a while! A new version of the Time Sampling Form is now available for your usage. Please let me know via info@jaapmarsman.com if you run into any issues.

As I'm picking up development on this app again, I've created a long list of improvements, but as you've seen, development can be a bit slow as this is strictly a hobby.

New features for this release:

- Updated the user interface to be a bit more modern. Not completely happy with it yet, but it's a start.
- Added an "Edit Report" button once the scoring is completed, so you can modify the report.
- Began with under the hood work for a multilingual version.
